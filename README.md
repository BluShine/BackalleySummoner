Created for Global Game Jam 2016. 

Welcome to Back Alley Summoner. You are a poor demon summoner selling your services out of an alley. Different rituals summon different demons, and different demons do different things.  You need to experiment to get higher level ones, like substituting ingredients to get stronger or weaker variants.

Summon demons to fulfill requests made by your clients. Requests will appear in this notebook.

To summon demons, click on ingredients in your inventory to put them in the pentagram. 

Different categories of ingredients correspond to different parts of the demons: head, body, and limbs. Different ingredients effect different stats of the demon: power, cleverness, seduction, deception, and occult. Demon stats effect their ability to complete different tasks when you summon them. 

You have to experiment with different ingredient combinations to determine what ingredients you need for certain tasks. 

At the end of a round, you will receive varying amounts of Hellbucks and reputation points depending on how well your demons completed their tasks. Hellbucks is money -- it indicates your score in the game. Your reputation is how well liked and known you are to clients. Gain reputation to be able to summon higher tier demons.  

If you need more ingredients you can send a demon to fetch you more at the cost of some of your reputation. You can't be wasting too much time fetching ingredients and ignoring your clients!
